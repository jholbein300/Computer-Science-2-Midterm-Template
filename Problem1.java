//For this problem
    //Make a program that asks a user three questions:
        //What is your name?
        //What is your favorite color?
        //Who inspires you the most?
    //Store these inputs as a string and have it output this:
        //"Your name is [user_name], your favorite color is [color], and you are most inspired by [inspirational_name]"
