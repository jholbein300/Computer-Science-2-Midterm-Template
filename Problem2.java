//Write a program that asks 5 times "How old are you?"
    //If the age is below 18, say "You cannot gamble."
    //If the age is above 18, print "You are able to gamble! Don't get carried away."
    //If they enter something that is not a number, is <0, or is >80 then print "This is not a valid age."
