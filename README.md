Before doing anything, go to the terminal and run this command:

javac readLine.java

If you don't, then you wont be able to use readLine


IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!
When you call readLine, the syntax is slightly different here than in codespaces

    To readline, you call readLine.readLine
    To readint, you call readLine.readInt
    To readboolean, you call readLine.readBoolean
    To readdouble, you call readLine.readDouble


To see how it works, you can look at the example.java file. DO NOT DELETE THE readLine.class OR readLine.java FILES.
IF YOU DO, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO USE THESE FUNCTIONS AND YOU CAN NOT PASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

When you want to run a program, go to the bottom of your screen where it says terminal, and type in java [filename]
    So for example, if you wanted to run Problem1.java after you worked on it, you would type (without quotes) "java Problem1.java" in the terminal and it will run
